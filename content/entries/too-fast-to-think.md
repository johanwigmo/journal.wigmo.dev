To be creative your mind must be rested and stress-free. Sleep is frequently overlooked when it comes to improved creativity, people who prioritizes sleep tends to have tends to have both more creativity and cognitive power. 

You should widen your creativity and avoid a narrow focus - to become creative, you need to do creative things. If you want to paint, you could also try other creative things like writing or dancing. 

Your left brain handles critical thinking and analysis, while your right brain is in charge of emotions and creativity. They tend to work together, but for the right side to start being creative you left side must first finish evaluating possible worry and fear. This is where routines and habits play an important part, as they distract the left brain. 

To harness your creativity, you should use these eight creative traits; Quite, Engage, Dream, Relax, Release, Repeat, Play, and Teach. Try to have a still moment by yourself, sit alone and allow yoruself to daydream. Or start teaching others about your passion. Surely, new ideas will come.
