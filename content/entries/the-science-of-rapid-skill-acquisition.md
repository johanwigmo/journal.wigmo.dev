When learning, you should break down your goals into more manageable steps, helping you to progress faster. Mistakes and challenges are essentials to learn, find a way to persist through these. Overambitious expectations will make the progress feel slow, while overly modest ones makes it feel uninteresting.

There are six stage that you need to go through, in order without skipping a step, to master a subject:

- Remembering, 
- Understanding, 
- Applying 
- Analyzing, 
- Evaluating, 
- and Creating.

Aim for *skill stacking*, becoming part of the top  % is nearly impossible but stacking "good enough" skills can create an unique combination of abilities. Reaching the top 10-15% is doable by reading a few books, attending a course and some deliberate hands-on practice. See the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) - 20% of work creates 80% of the outcome.
