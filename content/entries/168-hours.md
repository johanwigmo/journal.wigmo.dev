You're not too busy, you're just not in control of your time. Instead of think *Am I too busy?* you should ask yourself *Is this a priority?*

Every week has 168 hours. The average American sleeps for 8 hours each night and works about 43 hours per week. That leaves 69 hours for everything else, every week. But keeping up with modern life makes us feel there's no time left to engage in the things that make us happy. You can understand how you're actually spending your time by creating a time log, log everything you do for each hour for 2-3 weeks. Only then you will get an accurate picture of what you're doing with your time. 

Time-poor vs. Time-rich.Focus on your core competencies and oursource as much as possible of everything else. Find work that will challenge you at just the right level, this will foster a sense of happiness. And the happier you are, the more productive you'll be.

Plan your leisure time throughout the week. Find common interests with your kids, prioritize quality time over household chores, "turn off" your smartphone and make plans away from the TV. Being a couch potato won't do anything for your sense of fulfilment. Find ways to get chores done more effectively, a clean house every day probably won't make you as happy as reading a good book.

Also. Teams meeting sucks, and takes up a huge amount of your working day.
